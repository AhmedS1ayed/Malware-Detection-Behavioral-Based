# Malware-Detection-Behavioral-Based
Based on the pattern of allocating and deallocating 200Mb in the memory

## process.c is the process file which will make the pattern
It allocate useing malloc() and deallocate using free() with a delay of 10 sec between them
## process is the compiled c file
Compilation happened using GCC compiler
## Scanner.py is the Scanner that will detect the pattern and kill the process
It iterates over the permitted and non zombie processes to scan the pattern .
when the pattern happens more than 3 times it kills the process.
